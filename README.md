# zpz

Reads Excel file for projects, tasks, notes, dates, task time; prints associated project and task notes; brings up window to input task notes, track task time; writes notes and associated meta info to single Excel sheet located on the computer and in the cloud. Can use if no cloud document is available. Will need to install a number of Python packages.

**zpz_b** is not functional yet, but is being repurposed to be used for concatenating data from multiple files in the directory that have slightly different names (occasionally, multiple files will be added to Box when there is overlap in saving the Documents out of order).
